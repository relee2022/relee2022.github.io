title: "The Set Splittability Problem"

permalink: /publication/setsplittability
excerpt: 'The set splittability problem is the following: given a finite collection
of finite sets, does there exist a single set that contains exactly half the
elements from each set in the collection? (If a set has odd size, we allow
the floor or ceiling.) It is natural to study the set splittability problem
in the context of combinatorial discrepancy theory and its applications,
since a collection is splittable if and only if it has discrepancy at most 1.
We introduce a natural generalization of the splittability problem
called the p-splittability problem, where we replace the fraction 1
2 in the definition with an arbitrary fraction p âˆˆ (0, 1). We first show that the
p-splittability problem is NP-complete. We then give several criteria for
p-splittability, including a complete characterization of p-splittability for
three or fewer sets (p arbitrary), and for four or fewer sets (p = 1
2 ). Finally we prove the asymptotic prevalence of splittability over unsplittability in
an appropriate sense.'
