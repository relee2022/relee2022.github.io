# Welcome to my page!

Welcome to my website!  My name is Cash, and I'm an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at California State University, Stanislaus.  I love baseball, the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and spending time with my wife and our animals!

# My Favorite Organizations and Affiliations

## [Project NeXT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next)

Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. It also provides the participants with a network of peers and mentors as they assume these responsibilities. Since 1994 there have been over 2,300 Fellows, who have appeared in all capacities in the academic mathematical profession.

I was a Project NeXT Fellow in 2022-2023!

## [Research Experience for Undergraduate Faculty](https://reuf.aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/)

This workshop, sponsored by AIM, ICERM, and the NSF, equips faculty to involve their students in areas of active research.

The workshop is one in a series of annual REUF workshops that brings together faculty at undergraduate institutions who are interested in engaging in research with their students. The workshop is also a research renewal opportunity for faculty who want to reengage in research or are considering a change of research area.

The goals of the workshop are to promote undergraduate research in undergraduate institutions, and to forge lasting research collaborations among the participating faculty. The majority of the workshop will be spent working in small research groups on problems, reporting on progress, and formulating plans for future work. In addition, there will be opportunities for participants to continue research activities beyond the workshop week.

I participated in REUF in August of 2023!

## [Stan State Career and Professional Development Center](https://www.csustan.edu/career)

Our dedicated team assists students across all majors make academic and career decisions to help them gain career experience, pursue employment, and further their education.

Empowering students to embrace their unlimited potential!

I am the first ever CPDC Faculty Fellow in 2023-2024!

## [Stan State Faculty Mentor Program](https://www.csustan.edu/fmp)

The Faculty Mentor Program is a program for undergraduate students who are first-generation college students.  Each student gets paired with a faculty member at Stan.

I have been a faculty mentor in FMP since the fall of 2022, and currently have 2 mentees!

## [Lathisms](https://www.lathisms.org/)

Lathisms (Latinx and Hispanics in the Mathematical Sciences) was founded in 2016 with the mission of showcasing the contributions of Latinx and Hispanic mathematicians during Hispanic Heritage Month (from September 15 to October 15). Our goal is to provide an accessible platform that features the multifaceted and diverse nature of the Latinx and Hispanic mathematics community and inspires the younger generation of Latinx mathematicians.

## [CSUBIOTECH](https://www.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/csuperb)

Biotechnology improves our lives and our planet. It’s used to develop technologies and products such as biofuel, medicine and vaccines. CSUBIOTECH (formerly CSUPERB) is a committed network of faculty, deans and presidents representing the CSU’s 23 campuses. Together, their work champions biotechnology innovation and helps students embark on life science careers through experiential learning opportunities.

CSUPERB is dedicated to developing a diverse and professional biotechnology workforce for California and the global economy.

I am a Faculty Consensus Group representative from Stan State from 2023-2024.

## [Central California Math Project](https://www.csustan.edu/math/ccmp)

The Central California Mathematics Project at California State University, Stanislaus is one of 19 regional math projects through the California Math Project.

Funded by the state and federal Departments of Education, CCMP serves K-12 Mathematics teachers in Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Amador, Tuolumne, and Calaveras regions. It provides rigorous professional development, aligned with Ca-CCSSM, designed by K-12 and university educators, to enhance student learning and foster understanding of mathematics.

CCMP is located in the Department of Mathematics at California State University, Stanislaus.

I attended the 2023 CCMP summer workshop: Social Justice in the Classroom - Putting Theory into Practice!

## [STEM-NET](https://www.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/stem-net)

STEM-NET promotes research, community building and innovative educational ideas across the CSU university system and provides students the skills they need to excel in the workforce of the future and meet the needs of California’s innovative and evolving economy.

I attended the 2023 STEM-NET "Becoming more than the sum of our parts" conference!

## [Math Alliance](https://mathalliance.org/)

Our goal is simple: we want to be sure that every underrepresented or underserved American student with the talent and the ambition has the opportunity to earn a doctoral degree in a mathematical or statistical science.

Our commitment is to build a national community of students, faculty, and staff who will work together to transform our departments, colleges, and universities into institutions where all students are welcome. Our mentors come from a variety of schools all over the country. What they all have in common is a commitment to our Math Alliance Scholars.
